  Help us Prioritize

  - Issues that describe regressions in behavior (i.e. a feature that used to
  work as expected in a prior release) are treated with a higher priority.

  - Issues that have not been reproduced in the most recent stable release are
  treated with the lowest priority.

  - Issues that describe an unexpected behavior when a component or API is used
  in a non-standard manner or on a less common environment will be considered
  as enhancements that fall under the community's responsibility to implement.

  Mark with an X between the [square brackets] if any of the following statements 
  are true.
-->

- [ ] This is a regression. The last known version where this behaved as expected is:
- [ ] I have reproduced this issue in the most recent stable release.
- [ ] I have reproduced this issue after building from source (`master`).
