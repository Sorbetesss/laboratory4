이 웹사이트를 통해 여기까지 잘 따라왔다면, 이제는 꽤 그럴듯한 React Native 앱을 만들 수 있습니다. 하지만, React Native는 단지 한 회사만의 제품이 아니라 수 많은 개발자들이 만들어 나가고 있습니다. React Native에 관심이 있는 개발자라면, 여러분이 보고싶어할 만한 것들이 여기 있습니다.

## 인기있는 라이브러리

React Native를 사용하고 있다면, 이미 [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)는 알고 있을 것입니다. 그래서 React를 언급하는 것이 조금 우습기도 합니다. 아직 접해보지 않았다면, 모던한 웹사이트 만드는 최고의 방법인 React를 확인하세요.

한 가지 공통된 질문은 'React Native 애플리케이션의 "state"를 어떻게 관리하느냐' 입니다. 이를 위한 가장 유명한 라이브러리는 [Redux](http://redux.js.org/)입니다. Redux에서 "reducer"라는 용어를 얼마나 자주 쓰는지 두려워 마세요 - 꽤 심플한 라이브러리 이고, 이 내용을 잘 설명해주는 여러 [동영상](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux)이 있습니다.

다른 특별한 역할을 하는 라이브러리를 찾는다면, 데모, 기사 등을 포함하는 선별된 목록으로 이루어진 [Awesome React Native](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/)를 확인하세요.

## Examples

Try out apps from the [Showcase](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html) to see what React Native is capable of! There are also some [example apps on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactNativeNews/React-Native-Apps). You can run the apps on a simulator or device, and you can see the source code for these apps, which is neat.

The folks who built the app for Facebook's F8 conference in 2016 also [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/fbsamples/f8app) and wrote up a [detailed series of tutorials](http://makeitopen.com/tutorials/building-the-f8-app/planning/). This is useful if you want a more in-depth example that's more realistic than most sample apps out there.

## Extending React Native

- Looking for a component? [JS.coach](https://js.coach/react-native)
- Fellow developers write and publish React Native modules to npm and open source them on GitHub.
- Making modules helps grow the React Native ecosystem and community. We recommend writing modules for your use cases and sharing them on npm.
- Read the guides on Native Modules ([iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-ios.html), [Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-modules-android.html)) and Native UI Components ([iOS](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-ios.html), [Android](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/native-components-android.html)) if you are interested in extending native functionality.


## Development Tools

[Nuclide](https://nuclide.io/) is the IDE that Facebook uses internally for JavaScript development. The killer feature of Nuclide is its debugging ability. It also has great inline Flow support. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is another IDE that is popular with JavaScript developers.

[Ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) is a starter kit that uses Redux and a few different common UI libraries. It has a CLI to generate apps, components, and containers. If you like all of the individual tech choices, Ignite could be perfect for you.

[CodePush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) is a service from Microsoft that makes it easy to deploy live updates to your React Native app. If you don't like going through the app store process to deploy little tweaks, and you also don't like setting up your own backend, give CodePush a try.

[Expo](https://docs.expo.io) is a development environment plus application that focuses on letting you build React Native apps in the Expo development environment, without ever touching Xcode or Android Studio. If you wish React Native was even more JavaScripty and webby, check out Expo.

The [React Developer Tools](docs/debugging.html#react-developer-tools) are great for debugging React and React Native apps.

## Where React Native People Hang Out

The [React Native Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/react.native.community) Facebook group has thousands of developers, and it's pretty active. Come there to show off your project, or ask how other people solved similar problems.

[Reactiflux](https://discord.gg/0ZcbPKXt5bZjGY5n) is a Discord chat where a lot of React-related discussion happens, including React Native. Discord is just like Slack except it works better for open source projects with a zillion contributors. Check out the #react-native channel.

The [React Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactjs) covers both React and React Native. Follow the React Native [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/reactnative) and [blog](/react-native/blog/) to find out what's happening in the world of React Native.

There are a lot of [React Native Meetups](http://www.meetup.com/topics/react-native/) that happen around the world. Often there is React Native content in React meetups as well.

Sometimes we have React conferences. We posted the [videos from React.js Conf 2017](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS3fZ46IGFirdqKTIxlws7e0) and [React.js Conf 2016](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLb0IAmt7-GS0M8Q95RIc2lOM6nc77q1IY), and we'll probably have more conferences in the future, too. Stay tuned. You can also find a list of dedicated React Native conferences [here](http://www.awesome-react-native.com/#conferences).
