React Native brings [**React**'s](https://reactjs.org/) declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS and Android.

## 📋 Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 9.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS by default. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## 🎉 Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native](https://snack.expo.io/@hramos/hello,-world!)
- [Creating a New Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html)

## 📖 Documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on our [website](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html).

The React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/).

The source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [**@facebook/react-native-website**](https://github.com/facebook/react-native-website).

## 🚀 Upgrading

Upgrading to new versions of React Native may give you access to more APIs, views, developer tools and other goodies. See the [Upgrading Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/upgrading) for instructions.

React Native releases are discussed in the React Native Community, [**@react-native-community/react-native-releases**](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-releases).
